# Visualizing-Earnings-Based-on-College-Majors

In this project, we will explore data quickly through visualizations using pandas plotting functionality along with the Jupyter notebook 
interface.

We will be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from colleges between 2010 and 2012. The original data on 
job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and 
aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the original dataset and released it on their [github](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

Using visualizations, we can start to explore questions from the dataset such as:
 - Do students in more popular majors make more money? 
  * Using scatter plots
 - How many majors are predominantly male? 
  * Using histograms
 - Which category of majors have the most students?
  * Using bar plots
